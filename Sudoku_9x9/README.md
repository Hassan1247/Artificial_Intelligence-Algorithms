## Section 1 : Backtrack and forward checking `1.backtrack_and_FC.py`

In this section we only have backtrack and forward checking algorithms.

## Section 2 : Minimum Remaining Values `2.mrv.py`

In this section we update the section 1 file with Minimum Remaining Values (MRV).

## Section 3 : Least constrained value `3.lcv.py`

In this section we update the section 2 file with Least constrained value (LCV).

## Section 4 : Arc Consistency Algorithm #3 `4.ac3.py`

In this section we update the section 3 file with Arc Consistency Algorithm #3 (AC-3).

5.reprtive.py
6.addFeature.py
7.newAC3.py
8.py

## The sample inputs:

 The sample inputs are `input1` , `input2` and `input3` files you can run the programms in UNIX with this:

```bash
python 2.mrv.py < input1
```
the `input1` file is an easy sudoku.

After section 3 the app is very slow so it's better to use
